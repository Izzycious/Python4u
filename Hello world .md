Oh yeah finally i want to take python seriously and hopefully build something out of it. This will be a completely beginners platform, for i am also going to be learning and writing about all have learnt on python.

The motive of this is to LEARN and DO.

At the end of the of each article i would be writing, it will give you a grounded knowledge of how python works. I'm huge fan python for a while now but one way or the other i never started it, it high time that i started getting serious about it.

So this is how it's will be structured

    Whatever i learn and i will write about it.

    Drop some links and resources to help you on your own.

    Open to answering an questions, hopefully i can help

The main motive of doing this is for me to dive into MACHINE LEARNING and i hope find this really interesting.

Let's get started!!
