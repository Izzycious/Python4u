 =
 x = 7   
 #this means x is equal to 7




+=
#if this applied to any value it means there is an addition in the variable , let us see some example below

x = 7

x += 3

#the output of this would be 10 meaning 7 plus 3 
-----------------------------------------------------
-=
#a vice versa of the above one

x = 7
x -= 3
#the output will be 4 as it subtracts 7 from 3
-----------------------------------------------------
*=
#multiply assignment

x = 7
x *= 3
#the output will be 21 as it multiply 7 by 3
-----------------------------------------------------
/=
#divisible assignment

x = 10
x /= 2
#the output will be 5. as it divides 10 by 
-----------------------------------------------------
//=
#rounding up the divisible assignment

x = 7
x //= 3
#the output will be 2 as it divides 7 by 3 and it rounds it up to the nearest whole number
-----------------------------------------------------
%=
#a vice versa of the above one

x = 7
x %= 3
#the output will be 1 as it gets the remainder
