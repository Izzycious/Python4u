# Python4u

Hi Python4u is a documentation of what i have learnt in the simplest form.

Python is quite an easy language to learn and i love that one day i'd be resourceful with it, the aim of doing is to track my progress as i am never consistent in doing an open source thing and my learning is a bit slow and i would love do this by all means.
I imagine myself as an ML engineer at Netflix some day and it's going to be a dream come true.

For anyone interested in learning the main content of python could also follow up perhaps it possibly will help.

Let's get started
